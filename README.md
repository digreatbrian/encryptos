        python -m pip install encryptos

### Prerequisites

No extra modules have to be installed to use this module but only python built-in modules will be used.

## Deployment

After installation,just use this module like this::
     
     from encryptos import encrypt,decrypt

     key="secret_key"
     string_="unencrypted_string"

     encrypted=encrypt(string_,key)
